quiz code in c++ tried to make it look like the real one as much as possible considering it is in just in consoled 
so I put questions that should be asked to a user and 4 possible answers  in an array then the random function chooses ur version/type its A, B, or C 
after that, the program starts to ask questions and give options like answering the question, returning to the previous one, skipping the question, and at last shows u the results.
